# JavaScript Spectrogram Surface 3D

![JavaScript Spectrogram Surface 3D](3dSpectrogramSurface.png)

This demo application belongs to the set of examples for LightningChart JS, data visualization library for JavaScript.

LightningChart JS is entirely GPU accelerated and performance optimized charting library for presenting massive amounts of data. It offers an easy way of creating sophisticated and interactive charts and adding them to your website or web application.

The demo can be used as an example or a seed project. Local execution requires the following steps:

- Make sure that relevant version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is installed
- Open the project folder in a terminal:

        npm install              # fetches dependencies
        npm start                # builds an application and starts the development server

- The application is available at *http://localhost:8080* in your browser, webpack-dev-server provides hot reload functionality.


## Description

This example shows a use case for 3D Surface Series as a 3D *spectrogram*

Spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies. Spectrograms can be used to visualize any wave form. Most often spectrograms are used to display audio signals.

The spectrogram shows frequency on one axis (X Axis) and time on the other (Z Axis). The amplitude of the frequency is displayed both by the Y coordinate as well as the dynamically applied *color*.
